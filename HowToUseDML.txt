BASIC SYNTAX:
  - When asked for a "TYPE" input one of the following WALL, DOOR, or EMPTY
  - When asked for a 'TRAIT' you have a different set of options depending on the type being modified
      - WALL: You can enter the direction it's facing (N, E, S, W, UP, SIDE, CORNER)
      - DOOR: You can enter if the door is opened or closed (O, OPEN, C, CLOSED)
      - EMPTY: This will empty the tile given so no specific trait is required but it is recommended to use null, none, or foo
  - To make a comment just use the pound sign (#) and anything after that will be ignored by the compiler
  - After writing the basic syntax of a command anything added afterwards will be ignored and this can be used to
